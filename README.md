# Tensorflow, Pytorch and OpneCV Environment Checker with python
Environment checker for Tensorflow and Pytorch with OpenCV.  
2 files are included, each for Tensorflow and Pytorch environment.   
WebCamera is required for OpeCV is available.  
If you run the code, you can check the version of TF/Pytorch and it is running on CPU or GPU.  
The image window will open if the OpenCV can get the image from WebCamera.  
The code will be finished by "ESC" key.
